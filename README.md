# Monochromatic Color Generator

A simple web application built with React and Tailwind CSS that generates multiple shades of a given base color in hex format. You can also copy the generated hex color to your clipboard. The project uses the `tinycolor2` library to generate the color shades.

## Features

- Input a base color in hex format (e.g., `#ff5733`).
- Choose the number of shades to generate (between 1 and 20).
- Generates a monochromatic palette of shades from lightest to darkest.
- Click on a shade to copy the color's hex value to the clipboard.
- Responsive, card-based UI with Tailwind CSS styling.
